A data-driven project exploring healthcare datasets to reveal patterns, assess data quality, and present key insights through compelling visuals.  
This README documents only the first two completed phases: **Data Exploration** and **Data Visualization**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration  
**Goal:** Understand the dataset‚Äôs structure, quality, and key characteristics before analysis.

**Steps Performed**
- Loaded the dataset and examined dimensions, column names, and data types.  
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).  
- Explored relationships between variables using correlation matrices.

**Outcome:**  
Cleaned and profiled the data, revealing potential trends and preparing it for downstream analysis.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization  
**Goal:** Communicate insights clearly using visual representations.

**Techniques Used**
- **Histograms & Boxplots:** Show data distributions and detect outliers.  
- **Bar & Line Charts:** Capture categorical comparisons and time-series trends.  
- **Heatmaps:** Visualize correlations across features.

**Outcome:**  
Interactive visuals highlighted key relationships and patterns, guiding subsequent modeling and decision-making.

*Next Steps:* Future phases (e.g., predictive modeling) will build on these insights once the exploration and visualization groundwork is complete.
